          Eliminating Fears
        </header>
        <p className="text-lg">
          The last three parts of this section are crucial to eliminating fears.
          But in this section, we will talk about exposing ourselves to our
          fears. Please note that OCD fears like Schiz OCD, Existential OCD,
          Harm OCD, and all other OCD themes should be done with a licensed OCD
          ERP therapist. These fears are more anxiety and DPDR-related (fear of
          leaving the house, fear of flying, fear of driving, or fear of
          everything).

          Exposure: Eliminate fears slowly
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-center">
          The list we provided is just a couple of anxiety disorder
          sufferers&apos; fears. It is essential to practice the techniques
          given in the eliminating anxiety and intrusive thoughts section as
          well. To eliminate fears, you need to expose yourself SLOWLY to those
          fears. The reason why I say slowly is because your nervous system may
          still be very stimulated. You do not want to throw a lot of stress,
          especially in the early stages. This also does not mean you should
          spend 1-3 years on one fear. You must expose yourself to a new fear as
          soon as you feel ready, even if you do not want to do it. With
          exposure and the techniques given for intrusive thoughts/anxiety, you
          will be able to regain your life. Let me show you an example of
          exposure with my personal story.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          When I first had my big panic attack, I feared absolutely everything.
          I was scared of my wife, myself, my own hands/body, my eyes, my
          thoughts, the sky, cars, trees, going outside, being in crowded areas,
          being alone, driving, not having a signal on my phone, etc. I had an
          excessive amount of fear; I was unable to live my life at all. When I
          first had that panic attack, I wasn&apos;t going to fly on a plane
          immediately. Remember in the &quot;treat your anxiety disorder
          recovery like a physical recovery&quot; section? If I sprain my ankle,
          am I going to run a 5-mile marathon? No, I need to recover slowly and
          expose my leg to stress over time. The same applies to mental health.
          I slowly conquered fears over time. It was terrifying, but I set
          realistic goals and expectations. In my first months, I slowly
          conquered leaving the house. I then began to conquer driving and going
          out in public. The whole time I had a crutch, my wife. It is okay to
          have these crutches in the beginning, but you need to get rid of them
          slowly over time. As I conquered small tasks, I moved on to bigger
          fears. I slowly started doing things by myself. Once I conquered
          driving with my wife, I began driving alone. One year later, I was
          back to living life. I conquered planes, driving, rollercoasters, etc.
          I basically conquered everything. It was a very rough ride, but I am
          glad I kept exposing myself every week/month.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-center">
          Remember, I did this for over 1-2 years. You won&apos;t be ready to go
          on a rollercoaster or a plane from one day to another. Your nervous
          system is still stimulated. You can&apos;t put too much strain on it.
          But you need to know yourself. If deep down inside, you feel like you
          are ready to drive again, you need to push and face that fear. Do not
          avoid. There is a difference between avoiding and letting your nervous
          system recover more. Only you know your body and limits. Set goals and
          reminders for yourself! Conquer a new fear every week if you can. If
          you feel like you need more time, conquer a fear every month.
          Remember, you know your limits. Be realistic and kind to yourself.

          Irrational Fears, Fears in your head
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-center">
          For irrational fears like health anxiety fears, O.C.D. fears, and
          other fears(fear of the sky, fear of your own body), you need time for
          your nervous system to recover and rewire your brain. To rewire your
          brain, you must implement the R.A.R.M. method every time you get a bad
          intrusive thought or a negative sensation. Your nervous system is all
          over the place, which is why crazy fears are being thrown at you. Let
          your nervous system recover and implement the R.A.R.M. method as much
          as possible. If your feel like your fears need exposure, do it if
          possible (with a therapist if it&apos;s O.C.D.). For fears of the sky,
          I kept implementing the R.A.R.M. method and looking at the sky every
          month. Over time I noticed my body was not scared anymore. As I
          conquered fears, I began laughing at why I was even scared in the
          first place.
