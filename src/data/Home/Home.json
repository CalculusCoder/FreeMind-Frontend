    "description": " Hello there! I'm Jared, a software engineer who loves building websites and software, exploring new places, hiking, and playing many sports. But I'm also much more than that – I'm the creator and founder of FreeMind. You see, not too long ago, I was a different person, living a different life. I never imagined I'd find myself grappling with serious mental health disorders that would change the course of my life. I experienced firsthand the incapacitating effects of severe anxiety, OCD, and DPDR, conditions that impaired me so badly, I lost almost everything. I was unable to function for almost a year. But here I am today. I'm proof that recovery is possible because I've journeyed from being at my lowest to near-complete recovery. My experiences have inspired me to create a platform where others don't have to feel as lost or alone as I once did. At FreeMind, our mission is to offer affordable, effective, and accessible recovery services and support to everyone. We understand that the cost of mental health programs can be a substantial barrier for many. I was unable to afford $300 anxiety recovery programs when I was at my lowest. So, I built FreeMind to be the program I desperately needed back then – one that could provide guidance, understanding, and financial accessibility. We're here to bridge that gap and provide a supportive environment that doesn't break the bank. Welcome to FreeMind, your new ally in your journey toward recovery."
