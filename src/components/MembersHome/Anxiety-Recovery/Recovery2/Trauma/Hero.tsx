          Trauma, Environmental Factors, and Toxic Family.

        <p className="text-lg">
          These three factors are one of the most challenging things to cover.
          The reason is that you need a strong support system when you are in
          recovery. Sometimes that support system does not exist, but other
          times that &quot;support system&quot; is the reason why you are not
          recovering. Even worse, that support system may be why you are dealing
          with anxiety disorder in the first place. Trauma and environmental
          factors can lead to anxiety disorders developing and lead to nervous
          system dysregulation. Let&apos;s talk about trauma first and how you
          can possibly deal with it.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">Trauma</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Trauma can happen due to so many events in life. Maybe you have been
          through some horrible traumatic experiences in your life. Maybe you
          experienced the death of a loved one, war, divorce, physical abuse,
          sexual abuse, emotional/mental abuse, or natural disasters. If you are
          experiencing trauma or believe you might be, you must address those
          traumatic events. Please know that you are not alone and that it is
          not your fault. This was out of your control, and you did your best to
          push through such horrible events. I went through some severe trauma
          caused by my family and from nearly experiencing death. Most of the
          trauma stemmed from family, unfortunately. During the abuse, I
          endured, I began experiencing &quot;spiritual attacks&quot; (I was
          religious back then, but I still have faith in God). I did not realize
          that those &quot;spiritual attacks&quot; were panic attacks caused by
          abuse. It is unfortunate to be dealing with trauma; the situation is
          even worse when it causes your anxiety disorder. Trauma is a sensitive
          topic, so we will approach it with care.

          Seek professional help. Reach out to a mental health professional who
          specializes in trauma therapy. They can provide guidance, support, and
          evidence-based techniques to help you navigate and heal from the
          trauma. It is already tough to deal with anxiety disorders; adding
          trauma to the mix makes the situation 100 times worst.

        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Prioritize activities that promote your overall well-being. This may
          be engaging in exercise, getting enough sleep, maintaining a balanced
          diet, and participating in activities that bring you joy and
          relaxation.

        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          If you do not have a support system, establish one! My wife made up
          99% of my support system, but I wish I had more friends or people to
          give me advice and support. If you have no support system, reach out!
          Reach out to a therapist, a trusted family member, or a friend who
          will understand your situation. You can also contact one of our team
          members here at FreeMind! Note that FreeMind support is not a
          replacement for working with a therapist.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Be compassionate, kind, and patient with yourself. Sometimes we are
          extremely hard on ourselves. Blaming ourselves for our problems and
          sometimes suggesting we deserved the trauma or abuse we endured.
          Forgiveness and healing from trauma take a lot of time. The truth is,
          be kind to yourself and give yourself enough time.

          Recovering and negative environmental factors
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          This is one of the most challenging things to deal with. Not all of us
          have a strong support system, family members, friends, or financial
          accessibility to get support. Sometimes, we are surrounded by negative
          environmental factors: abusive parents, toxic family members, abusive
          relationships, negative friends, negative cultural influences, a bad
          community, and much more. Here is the truth, recovery in a bad
          environment is the hardest thing about recovery for some of us. These
          harmful environmental factors lead to more worry and stress,
          constantly stimulating our nervous system. I had heard so many stories
          of people feeling 100 times better when they escaped their bad
          environment to live in a peaceful and safe one. I had a friend tell me
          that he boosted his recovery from DPDR as soon as he left home and
          went away to college. His parents were promoting a negative and
          anxious atmosphere. He told me that the atmosphere they created made
          him anxious and stressed all the time, making his DPDR worse. He went
          on and made a full recovery. I am not telling you that running away or
          moving to a new city/state will heal you. What I am saying is that if
          your environment is very negative and promotes anxiety, abuse, or
          stress, it may cause your recovery to take long.

          Tips for dealing/living in a negative environment
        </header>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Safety first: prioritize your safety if you&apos;re in an abusive or
          dangerous situation. If you believe your situation is extremely
          dangerous, seek help from your therapist, local authorities, or
          support organizations to find ways to remove yourself from immediate
          harm.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Build a strong support system. Reach out to supportive people or
          organizations who can provide assistance, guidance, and emotional
          support, including friends, family members, helplines, therapists,
          support groups, or community organizations. They can offer resources
          and help you navigate your situation.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Seek professional help. Reach out to a mental health professional who
          specializes in trauma and anxiety therapy. They can provide a safe
          space for you to process your experiences, develop coping skills, and
          work towards healing and recovery.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Self Care. Prioritize activities that promote your overall well-being,
          including engaging in exercise, getting enough sleep, maintaining a
          balanced diet, and participating in activities that bring you joy and
          relaxation.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          If possible, change your environment. Reach out to friends, family, or
          other acquaintances that can help you make a move. I know it is a lot
          to ask for, but changing your environment can make recovery smoother,
          although recovery is always challenging.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Lastly, if you are not able to change your environment, stay hopeful!
          It will be a difficult journey, but your current situation is
          temporary. Keep building a strong support system, avoid toxic
          situations, and keep up with self-care. Better days are coming!
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">Toxic Family</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          You may have family members making you more anxious or stressed. For
          many of us, this is our current situation. Do not worry about
          recovery; as long as you implement all the recovery strategies and be
          patient, you will recover. You need to navigate your way around living
          in an anxious environment with toxic family members.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Try keeping a distance from toxic family members that do not live with
          you. It may be difficult, but keeping a distance can significantly
          help you. I used to have severe anxiety when coming close to toxic
          family members. They didn&apos;t even have to talk; my body was
          already throwing me signs that there was a threat around me. If you
          want to take it to the extreme, consider temporarily ending the
          relationship with them. Remember to think about this deeply, as it is
          not an easy topic to discuss.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          For family members that do live with you, set several boundaries and
          keep a distance. Learn how to cope with living in a toxic environment.
          Remember, your situation is temporary! Better days are coming.
