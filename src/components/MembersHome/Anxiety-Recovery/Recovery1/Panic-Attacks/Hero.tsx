          Eliminate Panic Attacks
        </header>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Before we get started, I would like to say that eliminating panic
          attacks is no easy task. It took me about 2-3 months to finally
          eliminate them. The ironic thing is that to stop panic attacks; you
          must befriend them. They must become your best friend in this journey;
          this is how you will eliminate them. Another thing to note is that
          there are hundreds of variations of the method I will show you. All of
          them generally accomplish the same thing. I would list them down for
          members, but I want to avoid dealing with copyright issues. The main
          thing I can say is that the pioneer of anxiety disorder recovery is
          Dr. Claire Weekes, she created the original method, and from there,
          many people have made their own variations. So, let&apos;s get
          started.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">You are safe</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Panic attacks CANNOT kill you, CANNOT make you go crazy, and CANNOT
          destroy your body. You are safe. At the moment, it might feel like the
          world is crumbling down on you. You might be urged to call 911 or call
          for help, but it is okay. A panic attack is just a false fire alarm.
          It&apos;s your stress response activating thinking that a thief broke
          into your home or that a bear is chasing you. You need to tell your
          body that it is okay, you are in no danger, you are 100% safe. And you
          need to be able to understand that everything will be okay; this will
          help your stress response turn off and let your body return to
          homeostasis.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16 font-semibold">
          R.A.R.L.M
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          To contain panic attacks, use the R.A.R.L.M. method. Note that this is
          a long-term recovery strategy. Over time, as you apply this technique
          to panic attacks, they will begin to reduce in frequency and
          intensity. You may lose some battles, but you will definitely win some
          as well. With this method, you are training your body to recognize
          that there is no threat. Ultimately ending panic attacks in the long
          run.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">R: RECOGNIZE</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Step one, RECOGNIZE. You must recognize what is happening in your
          body. You may be plagued with a million thoughts at the moment and may
          feel like escaping a situation or running away. Recognize and observe
          your thoughts, movements, and actions. If you start feeling sweaty,
          like you are choking or running out of air, or like you might go crazy
          or die, observe these movements and recognize them. You may also get a
          million thoughts at the moment: what if I die right here? What if I go
          crazy? What if I lose my career? What if I faint? These are all part
          of the stress response. Your nervous system is firing these sensations
          and symptoms to try to protect you. Recognize that this is a panic
          attack or just a false fire alarm. There is 0 harm coming your way,
          the thief and bear do not exist, and your stress response is
          activating even though you are safe!
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          When RECOGNIZING, it may be helpful to make an analogy. You can tell
          yourself things like there is no bear, no thief, this is just a false
          fire alarm, and there is no fire. You can also imagine your panic
          attacks and anxiety as a small harmless germ throwing a temper
          tantrum. This can help with recognizing and eliminating the fear of a
          panic attack.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">
          A: ACCEPT AND ALLOW
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          This is the heart of anxiety and panic attack recovery. Once you
          RECOGNIZE what is going on, you then ACCEPT AND ALLOW the panic
          attack. This is a scientifically backed approach (A.C.T.). Whatever
          you resist comes back with full force. DO NOT RESIST; this will make
          your situation worst. Not only are there studies to scientifically
          prove this, but I am also talking out of experience. Acceptance is the
          way you respond to anxiety and panic attacks. You either respond with
          acceptance or with resistance. Respond with acceptance. So what does
          it mean then to accept and allow? This means not running away from
          your situation. Allow the discomfort, the symptoms, the feelings, and
          the fear to float with you. You may be in a movie theater and start
          having a panic attack; once you recognize, you allow. You don&apos;t
          escape because that panic attack will follow you wherever you go. You
          sit through the movie, allowing discomfort, shortness of breath,
          fears, and everything else. Remember, you will not die, you will not
          go crazy, you will not lose everything, and you are safe. Let it sit
          with you through the movie, and let it float. Imagine it to be a funny
          germ-looking cartoon throwing a temper tantrum. Tell it that you will
          allow everything it throws at you. You can also imagine a fire alarm;
          you let the fire alarm continue to sound, nothing will happen. Yes,
          the fire alarm is loud and annoying, but sit and allow the symptoms,
          feelings, discomfort, and fears the fire alarm throws at you. It will
          eventually turn off if you accept these feelings. When accepting, you
          must get ready to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Acceptance
          is one of the most challenging things to master in the R.A.R.L.M.
          method.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Acceptance is one of the most difficult things to master in the
          R.A.R.L.M method. The reason is that you have to face your fears deep
          down inside and meet face-to-face with something you feel to be a huge
          threat to you. You have to invite it to stay with you and allow it to
          throw whatever symptoms and sensations at you. Another reason why
          accepting and allowing is hard to master is that many people accept in
          their minds but do not truly accept within. That is okay; I was the
          same way at the beginning. Initially, when I used to have panic
          attacks, I would tell myself, I accept and allow you, in my head
          repeatedly. The funny thing is that I would still run away from the
          situation and keep resisting. You may make the same mistakes as me,
          but over time you will begin to see the true meaning of accepting and
          allowing. Remember, accept, and allow all the feelings, panic,
          dissociation, fears, intrusive thoughts, and shortness of breath. Let
          your body throw its temper tantrum and observe it, it will pass, and
          you will be okay every SINGLE TIME!
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-purple-500 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          DO NOT ESCAPE. It may seem impossible, but you need to conquer these
          fears. You need to rewire your brain and nervous system to get
          comfortable in these situations. If you keep escaping, panic attacks
          and anxiety will rule your life.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          When I began having panic attacks, I kept escaping every situation.
          Here is the funny thing, though, the panic attack followed me wherever
          I went. Panic attacks do not care who you are, who you are with, and
          where you are. Your stress response will remain active, thinking there
          is a threat; you must accept and allow it wherever you are so it can
          pass. Since I kept escaping situations, I became more limited in where
          I could go. I had a panic attack at a stadium, fled, and avoided
          stadiums. I had a panic attack at the movie theater, escaped, and then
          avoided the theaters. I had a panic attack in a small building and
          escaped, so I avoided small buildings altogether. Do you see where I
          am going with this? Accept and allow, and DO NOT ESCAPE. Tell your
          brain and nervous system that the place you are in is not a threat,
          and the panic attack will soon subside! We will discuss exposing
          yourself to your fears in the eliminating fears sections.

        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">R: RELAX</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          It sounds pretty obvious. But it is possible. Usually, this part is
          done during the acceptance phase. You should start doing deep
          breathing exercises and breathing techniques for the RELAX phase.
          There are several different ones on the internet, but we will also
          show you some in later sections. We recommend looking up other
          techniques to determine which is best for you. On top of breathing
          exercises, you should find anything you believe will help you calm
          down. One of the best things that helped me was putting headphones on
          and listening to relaxation audio. Here at FreeMind, we have several
          different relaxation audios that can be used for panic and anxiety.
          Meditation is also a technique that can be used in the RELAX phase
          that can help someone calm down. Remember, different things work for
          different people. You need to find what works best for you. Audios may
          work great for me but may not work for some members. For the RELAX
          phase, here at FreeMind, we recommend a combination of breathing
          exercises and relaxation audio. This combination worked amazing for me
          when I had panic attacks. It can be done almost anywhere, at home,
          work, outside, event, etc. I would take headphones with me everywhere
          just in case I had a panic attack at an event. I would pop in a
          headphone and begin the relaxation breathing techniques if I felt a
          panic attack coming. At the beginning of my recovery, I had these
          headphones with me as crutches, which is okay if you are first
          starting off. Maybe your crutches aren&apos;t headphones; maybe they
          are having a pill to calm you at all times or having someone with you
          24/7. Regardless of your crutches, letting go of them slowly over time
          is crucial. We will discuss letting go of these crutches in the
          eliminating fears section.

        <p className="border-2 border-red-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          RELAX. Find a great combination of relaxation techniques that work
          great for you! Deep breathing exercises, relaxation audios, or
          meditation can be used for the RELAX phase. Make sure to check out the

          You are still in the middle of a panic attack
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          If you are in the Let Time Pass phase, You will do exactly what is in
          the name, LET TIME PASS. In this phase, you may still be in the middle
          of a panic attack (in the relax phase), or the panic attack may
          finally be subsiding or be gone. Let&apos;s talk about the first case
          if you are in the middle of a panic attack. If you are still in the
          middle of a panic attack, let time pass. Keep applying the relaxation
          and acceptance techniques. Stay strong through it, and keep telling
          yourself you are safe; the fire alarm will turn off soon! All the
          symptoms and sensations will be gone soon, just let the time pass, and
          the stress response will turn off soon.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-xl mt-16">
          Panic attack is subziding or is gone.
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          If you are in this stage, the panic attack is finally subsiding or is
          gone. You will feel the effects for some time, maybe even for hours.
          But be sure to remind yourself that it is just residual damage from
          the stress response. In this phase, your nervous system will be shaken
          up. Remember the example of the stress response and the thief breaking
          into your house? Will you be able to get a cozy, snuggly sleep after
          that incident? Of course not; your nervous system is shaken up, and
          you need to LET TIME PASS so it can return to homeostasis. The same
          applies to panic attacks; your nervous system is most likely shaken up
          and needs time to return to homeostasis. Regardless of where you are,
          take a step back and continue relaxing. If you are at work, don&apos;t
          immediately continue to start working; give yourself some time. Your
          health comes first! The same applies to any situation, work, school,
          sports, events, etc. Do not immediately go back into things if you are
          still shaken; you will continue stimulating your nervous system.
          Continue relaxing until you feel your body start to return to normal.
          Letting time pass is very important for panic attacks.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-blue-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Your health comes first. Make sure to talk to any bosses, coworkers,
          or friends that need to understand your situation. Tell them you need
          a moment to let time pass to allow your body to return to homeostasis.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">M: MOVE ON</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          In this phase, you need to MOVE ON. Your panic attack is gone at this
          stage, but your nervous system might still be slightly shaken up. That
          is okay as long as you give yourself enough time in the LET TIME PASS
          phase. MOVE ON and ENGAGE in whichever activity you were doing. The
          move-on phase is essential because you make sure you pay no attention
          to your racing mind. Your brain is throwing 1000 different questions,
          and you probably have 1000 different questions, but you need to move
          on as if nothing just happened. If you are at work, engage thoroughly
          in your work. If you are at the movie theater, engage thoroughly in
          the movie. It does not matter what you are doing; engage in anything
          you can find. This will rewire your brain to focus on what&apos;s
          important. Moving on is important because it is part of the acceptance
          process. If you move on as if nothing happened, your brain and nervous
          system will begin to understand that there is no threat. But, if you
          focus on it and glue your mind to it, your brain will still believe
          this is a threat and continue throwing fears and anxiety at you.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Remember the analogy of the little germ throwing a temper tantrum?
          That little germ may get furious that you are paying it no attention
          and accepting it for what it is. It may continue throwing tantrums
          (panic attacks), but that is okay. Continue with the R.A.R.L.M method,
          and over time that germ will get tired and notice that those
          tantrums/panic attacks are not causing you any harm. Eventually, it
          will leave you alone, and the panic attacks will subside.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-blue-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          The R.A.R.L.M method is a long-term strategy. It is not intended to
          get rid of panic attacks in 1 day. With the R.A.R.L.M method, you
          rewire your brain and nervous system to act normally. You teach them
          that there is no threat; the bear and thief do not exist!
