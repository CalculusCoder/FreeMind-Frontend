          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            It all started on June 1, 2022, although it really started way
            before. I was recently engaged to my fianc√©e, enjoying my life to
            the fullest in a new state. I had made several friends, felt
            physically and mentally well, and felt the happiest I had ever been.
            I was also making a career change and was excited about these new
            job opportunities that I had accepted. That day, I stayed up till
            around 2 AM doing schoolwork. At the time, I usually ended my nights
            at around 2 AM, followed by laying in bed for another hour on
            youtube. That day, something different happened. While lying in bed,
            I watched this youtube video about an influencer who digested a
            large number of drugs and later went &quot;clinically insane.&quot;
            Usually, these types of videos are just entertainment for me, but
            for some reason, that video got to my head that night.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            I decided to call it a night and tried sleeping, but I was
            terrified. This type of fear was different; it was not the type of
            fear that we get when we watch a scary movie; this was something
            else. As I tried falling asleep, I began getting crazy fears and
            intrusive thoughts about going crazy or hallucinating. I started
            having shortness of breath and feeling like I was going crazy. I got
            up and began pacing up and down the house, trying to calm myself
            down to no avail. This fear kept growing, and shortly after, my
            heart started racing at a million miles. My brain was filled with
            crazy intrusive thoughts, and I began to feel as if I was going to
            die. I almost ran to my neighbors for them to call 911 since I was
            alone at the time. I was hyperventilating, dissociating, shaking
            uncontrollably, and feeling dizzy all at the same time. I was 100%
            convinced that those hours by myself would be my last in this world;
            I was ready to die alone in my apartment.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            Eventually, I finally calmed myself down and managed to control
            myself. I looked at the time, and it was 8 AM; I stayed up the whole
            night, and it took me over 4 hours to calm myself down. As I walked
            to bed, I noticed that I had crushed my glasses and broken some
            items when I was freaking out. I tried falling asleep, but it would
            take me another hour to finally get some sleep. I was still slightly
            hyperventilating and felt fuzzy and off. Thankfully, I managed to
            get 4 hours of sleep and woke up at around 1 PM. As I woke up, I
            noticed that everything was different. I felt entirely disconnected
            and dissociated from my surroundings. It felt like I was stuck in a
            lucid dream and had not woken up. I noticed I was extremely
            disoriented, confused, and dizzy. My memory was also completely off.
            I brushed my teeth that afternoon four times because I genuinely
            forgot if I had brushed my teeth. I also woke up with 24/7 anxiety
            latched on to me. I was on edge and freaking out over everything
            every day. What just had happened to me was that I suffered from a
            severe and intense panic attack, which led me to develop chronic
            depersonalization derealization disorder and OCD. This day, on June
            1, 2022, was when everything would change for me. In a matter of a
            few hours, I would go from living my best life to losing everything
            over the next couple of months.

          <header className="text-center text-3xl">My Battle With DPDR</header>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            The next nine months of my life would be hell on earth. I thought
            this &quot;fuzzy&quot; feeling would last only a few weeks. I told
            myself that I just needed to relax, sleep earlier, and not work as
            much, and I would eventually go back to feeling normal.
            Unfortunately, I was wrong; I had a long road ahead of me. The same
            week as my panic attack, I stopped eating altogether. My skin turned
            pale, and I looked sick all the time. I was afraid to look in the
            mirror, and I deleted all social media and my photos app because I
            looked alien-like in my photos. When my wife came back from her
            trip, she looked completely foreign and scary to me. I could not
            look at my own wife for several months; it nearly scared me to
            death. People&apos;s faces looked scary, weird, alien-like, bright,
            and freaky. People also seemed like robots or characters in video
            games (NPCs). Ironically, I would joke with friends that certain
            people in my life were NPCs since they acted like robots and had no
            feelings. Well, now, everyone was a literal NPC to me. They looked
            and acted like robots floating around this world, and it was
            terrifying to think about.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            I also had horrible brain fog, confusion, dizziness, disorientation,
            dementia-like memory, weird dreams, brain chatter,
            hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and crazy intrusive thoughts.
            Trees, buildings, objects, animals, and almost everything looked
            creepy. DPDR was the worst when I would be inside a building.
            Everything looked super zoomed in as if I was still high off of a
            drug trip. I had this weird depth perception issue where things in
            my vision looked like they were moving with me. The floor and
            buildings around me looked like they were moving, like in the movie
            &quot;Inception.&quot; I also felt like I was watching myself from a
            distance, like in the film &quot;Get Out.&quot; I was in my brain
            just watching my movements, but I was not in control of them. I was
            a literal prisoner in my brain, unable to enjoy anything in life.
            People would talk to me, and I would be unable to understand
            anything.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            All my mental capabilities were gone overnight; I was unable to do
            any school work, any work, or anything in general. I began having
            irrational DPDR-related fears as well. I could not look at the sky
            because it freaked me out, and when people started acting weird, I
            would begin to panic. I also felt extremely weird watching tv; I
            could not immerse myself in it since it looked so creepy, which
            would lead to more DPDR. This would be my new life for the next 8+
            months and 24/7, with no sign of light at the end of the tunnel.

            My Battle With Anxiety
          </header>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            Just like DPDR, my severe anxiety issues started after my intense
            panic attack. On top of DPDR, I dealt with 24/7 lingering anxiety. I
            was on edge all the time and had all sorts of crazy anxiety
            symptoms. I lost over 20-30 lbs over the course of a month. I had to
            force myself to eat, and even like that, I would throw up all my
            food because I felt so sick. My skin turned pale; I was always weak
            and couldn&apos;t leave my room for over a week. I had crazy
            intrusive thoughts, shortness of breath, heart palpitations,
            nocturnal panic attacks, visual snow, floaters, numbness, confusion,
            brain fog, brain chatter, and so much more plague me 24/7. Anything
            would cause me to enter into a panic. I became sensitive to
            everything: loud noises, people, crowded areas, enclosed areas, and
            more. I started growing agoraphobic. I became fearful of going into
            elevators, buildings, cars, and malls. It got so bad once that I did
            not leave the house for a whole week. I was scared of being in my
            own skin. I ended up needing a million crutches. I needed my wife to
            be with me 24/7; I refused to drive, be alone, or do anything in
            general.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            Anxiety stripped everything from me. I didn&apos;t go out to events
            anymore, I didn&apos;t meet up with friends for months, and I
            couldn&apos;t even eat foods I liked because I lost my appetite. Due
            to my fears, I eventually lost my job since I feared leaving the
            house. I would have panic attacks every week, making my symptoms and
            DPDR 1000x worse. During my lowest with DPDR and anxiety, I cried
            endlessly for days. I felt suicidal every day, but I wasn&apos;t
            sure if it was in my heart or just OCD thoughts. Since my wife would
            work far, I would go with her and stay outside of where she worked;
            that&apos;s how bad it had gotten for me. It would be 3 AM some
            nights, and I would be outside of where she worked, sleeping in a
            car. I cried so much thinking of what was happening to me and that I
            lost my job and dropped out of school. Some days I would sleep at
            the library, where many homeless people would be, because I feared
            being alone at home. I remember feeling so lost those days. I would
            be on Google trying to find an answer to my problems. I thought I
            might have had a severe brain disease, cancer, or even just gone
            crazy.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            Unfortunately for me, things would continue to get worst. I started
            feeling suicidal 24/7 and fearing being alone because I would end my
            life. I became a massive responsibility for my fianc√©e. I had
            thousands racked in debt and had no source of income to pay it off.
            Eventually, I had to make a choice: check myself into a hospital for
            months until I became stable, or go back to my family&apos;s house
            where I was abused so someone could &quot;care&quot; for me. I
            remember sitting down at the library, contemplating what had
            happened. I was living my best life, with a new apartment, recently
            engaged, new jobs, and doing great in school, just so that it could
            be stripped away from me overnight. For the next eight months, I had
            new anxiety symptoms show up every week: tinnitus, trembling arms,
            numbness, brain zaps, deja vu, earworm, mind pops, flashbacks, and
            more. I had to rest in bed for three months until I could finally
            start looking for a part-time job. Once I found a part-time job, it
            was nearly impossible to keep it. Life became a living hell, and
            things would continue to get worse.

          <header className="text-center text-3xl">My Battle With OCD</header>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            For the first three months, I battled with severe anxiety, DPDR, and
            random crazy intrusive thoughts. After about three months, I was
            able to pick up a job, and trust me when I tell you; I wished I had
            gotten more rest instead of working. I wished I had not woken up so
            many mornings, the pain never ended, and I thought I would suffer
            with this forever. As if things were not bad enough already, around
            September - October, I began experiencing severe crazy intrusive
            thoughts of psychosis, schizophrenia, and hallucinations. I started
            feeling scared and paranoid that I may have those illnesses or
            already have them. These thoughts would initially hit me with full
            force for one week and then dissipate. The intrusive thoughts would
            come on and off for the next month or so. Eventually, I began
            experiencing mind pops, constant brain chatter, and extreme
            hyper-awareness. These symptoms led me to believe that I was going
            crazy and experiencing psychosis. I started constantly researching
            and Googling my symptoms, which made me more fearful‚Äîeventually, the
            fear of going crazy overwhelmed me completely. I entered into a 24/7
            state of hyperawareness.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            I constantly smelled and listened to everything around me to ensure
            I wasn&apos;t hallucinating. I would ask family members if they
            heard &quot;that&quot; noise, smelled &quot;that&quot; smell, or had
            seen &quot;that&quot; thing. My ears began pulsating because I
            thought I would start hearing things. I was overwhelmed with crazy,
            24/7 OCD thoughts. I began having thoughts like: &quot;What if my
            neighbors are spies,&quot; &quot;What if I am going crazy, but I
            just don&apos;t know,&quot; &quot;What if my family members are
            demons or fake,&quot; &quot;What if my friends are out to get
            me,&quot; &quot;What if satellites, light poles, traffic lights,
            cameras, helicopters, and much more are government equipment to spy
            on me?&quot; These thoughts would happen from the day I woke up to
            the day I fell asleep. I would even dream about these intrusive
            thoughts so many times. I had crazy compulsions and fears as well; I
            was genuinely scared to look at images, pictures, or animals because
            I feared they would start talking to me. I would be scared that
            people walking around were hallucinations. I would use my phone to
            record sounds and people I feared were hallucinations; as crazy as
            it sounds, it is all true. I was 100% convinced I was developing a
            psychotic disorder or going crazy; no one could change my mind.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            I booked several doctors, psychologists, and therapist appointments
            so they could determine my fate. I ended up canceling all
            appointments since I had no insurance and was in financial ruins;
            one more credit card transaction and I would have to declare
            bankruptcy. I began preparing to live with psychosis. I started
            imagining a future where I would need a caretaker and end up in a
            mental hospital until I died. Everything in my life revolved around
            these OCD fears. When someone talked about college, I began shaking
            because I heard stories of people going crazy in college. When
            someone would talk about me having children, I started shaking
            because I feared going crazy and killing my children once I had
            kids. Anything that people talked about, I made it about psychosis
            and going crazy. I did not have one normal thought for over 7+
            months. My life was no longer filled with thoughts like: when will I
            pay the bills, when will I find a job, when will I start planning my
            wedding, etc. My thoughts now revolved around psychosis and
            hallucinations.{" "}

          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            Why did this happen? Aside from all the crazy intrusive thoughts I
            was experiencing, I had this question/thought deep down in my soul,
            and I wanted an answer. I had several theories: God was punishing
            me, I had a severe brain injury that I didn&apos;t know about or a
            mix of both. One day in December, I dug deep into my past and did
            something I had never done in my life: I zoomed out and saw the
            bigger picture. On this day, I found out exactly why this had

          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            Believe it or not, I never believed in this. I thought trauma and
            abuse were for the weak (I&apos;ll talk about this later). I believe
            this is the number one cause of my severe DPDR, anxiety, and OCD
            issues. Growing up, I lived in an abusive and toxic environment.
            When my siblings and I were hit with brute force or treated like
            dogs, my mother always said, &quot;It&apos;s because your father is
            tough.&quot; My siblings and I were taught to take all verbal and
            physical abuse and not to &quot;break&quot; because we were men.
            Growing up, I lived up to these principles without issues; I never
            complained and was overall content with life.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            I was grateful that I had it easier than my older siblings; they
            were the ones that suffered the most abuse. When I turned 20,
            everything changed for me. I ended up getting into a family business
            deal, which to this day was the worst yet best decision of my life.
            Everything went continuously downhill for the next two years of my
            life. I went through verbal abuse 24/7. There were fights,
            discussions, and tension in the house every day from the morning I
            woke up till the night I fell asleep.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            This tension and abuse continued to grow for the next two years. I
            began having small panic attacks while at work, falling asleep, and
            being alone. My fiancee would have to come and comfort me so many
            nights because I had these &quot;spiritual&quot; attacks. I started
            feeling choked up, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and
            dissociation. My anxiety continued to get worst, going from mild to
            moderate. I can only scratch the surface of this story because it
            gets 1000x worst from here. The issue was this: I endured severe
            trauma and abuse and refused to believe it. My environment was a
            literal cancer and disease, yet I couldn&apos;t see it.{" "}

            Being Too Religious, Conservative, Old-School, and Hardcore
          </header>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            Remember when I said, &quot;I thought trauma and abuse were for the
            weak?&quot; Well, I actually believed that; I was too conservative
            and hardcore. I did not believe in mental health issues, trauma, or
            abuse. I thought you were weak if you did experience any of those
            issues. I&apos;m the last person you would expect to talk about
            mental health issues, yet mental health disorders nearly took me to
            the brink of suicide. When I was experiencing abuse from my father,
            I responded by working harder and living a fast-paced lifestyle. I
            thought, &quot;I could move out of this hellhole ASAP if I worked
            harder.&quot;; This was a huge mistake. This lifestyle led me to
            continue inducing chronic stress into my body. Stress mixed with
            abuse is a toxic ticking time bomb.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            I was way too conservative in this sense. I thought I was
            invincible; no harm could come to me if I continued stressing my
            body or being abused. Being too religious was also a big mistake.
            Being too religious kept me from seeking help since I thought these
            were all &quot;spiritual&quot; issues. What I didn&apos;t know was
            that my own environment and family were the root cause of the
            problem. Being hardcore by suppressing my emotions, feelings, and
            problems was a huge mistake. Instead of facing my issues, I buried
            and ran away from them. I suppressed the fact that my panic attacks,
            anxiety, and dissociation episodes were getting worst.{" "}

            The last major cause of my anxiety issues was that I was living a
            fast-paced lifestyle. When I made a family business deal, I took on
            a lot of new responsibilities in my life. I became a chronic
            worrier; I worried about finances, my future, school, business,
            relationships, and much more. I started having trouble sleeping due
            to the number of responsibilities I had. I would always be in a
            rush, even on days when I did not work or go to school. I&apos;m
            unsure if I learned that behavior over time from my environment or
            if I just picked it up genetically. Unfortunately, I continued being
            a chronic worrier and living a fast-paced lifestyle. Some nights I
            wouldn&apos;t even sleep because I was up doing schoolwork. This,
            combined with the other two factors, is why my anxiety continued to
            worsen over time.

            Months Leading Up to the Panic Attack
          </header>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            In the final two months before my big panic attack, I managed to get
            engaged, move out of my toxic environment, move to a new state, and
            land a job. I told myself I could finally be happy; I would never
            return to the environment that tortured me. But there was an issue:
            all those things that made me happy were also highly
            stress-inducing. Those events are huge and can put more stress on
            your body, regardless of whether you feel happy or not. When I moved
            into my new apartment, I began feeling some horrible episodes of
            feeling weird and fuzzy. Everything around me would look fake, 2D,
            and creepy. These episodes would last around 10 - 20 seconds at
            most. While shopping, I would also feel as if I was out of breath
            and dying. It felt as if they were short PTSD episodes(they
            weren&apos;t). I told my fiancee about getting an anxiety dog
            because I genuinely felt like I was going to die mid-episode (It may
            sound funny but I was seriously fearful). At this point, I began
            assuming I was dealing with anxiety because my fiancee told me that
            I was. I was skeptical, but I continued to assume it was just
            anxiety. One week before my panic attack, those anxiety and DPDR
            episodes became more intense and frequent. Eventually, I began
            fearing that maybe I was going &quot;crazy.&quot; One week later, I
            had the intense panic attack. After my panic attack, I was genuinely
            confused about why I had it. The issue was that I didn&apos;t zoom
            out; I didn&apos;t see my environment, behaviors, actions, and
            relationships. Once I zoomed out, I realized that I shouldn&apos;t
            have been surprised. I should have seen the panic attack coming from
            miles away.{" "}

            Making a Full Recovery
          </header>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            I spent months feeling lost, lonely, and confused about what I was
            going through. I searched for answers for countless hours on Google
            but did not find them there. I found my answer thanks to God and my
            fiancee. My fiancee told me that it seemed as if I was having panic
            attacks and dissociation. It turns out that she also suffered from
            DPDR and anxiety and had fully recovered! Once I discovered what I
            could possibly be suffering from, I researched for hours and
            thankfully found more answers. I was left in a state of shock once I
            read up on DPDR and anxiety. I decided to venture and create my own
            recovery program since I could not afford to purchase any recovery
            courses. I read several books and blogs, watched several videos, and
            talked with many people who had made a full anxiety/DPDR recovery. I
            kept myself educated and continued to keep on top of my mental
            health. When OCD hit me in October, it felt like I returned to
            square one. I had no idea what I was suffering from and was 100%
            convinced that I was going crazy or had gone crazy. Thankfully,
            after researching more on DPDR, I found even more answers. A user on
            a website online once told me that I should check myself for OCD. I
            told myself, &quot;What? That is ridiculous. OCD is a hand
            washing/cleaning disorder.&quot; Once again, I was wrong, but I was
            thankful for that user who led me to get an accurate diagnosis. I
            was diagnosed with OCD, specifically Pure-O OCD, a subtype of OCD. I
            was baffled, but I was thankful that none of my fears were actually
            true. Once I received a diagnosis, I continued to work on self-help
            therapy and my mental health. I worked on containing compulsions,
            eliminating fears, exposing myself to fears, controlling chronic
            worry, and managing stress. Fast forward to today, more than one
            year later, I have made a near-full recovery from anxiety, DPDR, and
            OCD. I have conquered all types of fears, I feel
            &quot;connected&quot; with myself and the people around me, and I
            have decreased OCD thoughts by over 70-80%. What I once thought was
            impossible became very possible. You might hear this thrown around
            in the anxiety community, but anxiety can sometimes be a blessing in
            disguise. Remember when I said the &quot;worst/best&quot; decision
            was signing that business deal? That&apos;s because although I lost
            everything in my battle with anxiety, DPDR, and OCD, I gained so
            much more. I got rid of all toxic relationships and managed to save
            certain relationships in my life. I managed to build a strong
            support system, find great new friends, move into a better state,
            and find better work-related connections. I have become genuinely
            happy with who I am and who I have become as a person. I would have
            continued being ungrateful, hateful, grumpy, and bitter if it
            wasn&apos;t for anxiety. It doesn&apos;t matter if you are
            intelligent, stubborn, weak, strong, tall, short, rich, or poor;
            anxiety disorders do not discriminate. Anxiety can come for you and
            your life. Anxiety disorders can destroy your relationships, career,
            and mental/physical health. But thankfully, recovery is possible for
            OCD, DPDR, and anxiety. Just as anyone can come down with these
            mental health disorders, anyone can make a full recovery!

          <p className="mt-8 text-xl">
            FreeMind was initially a project that I was working on to show to an
            employer. This project was so I could showcase my skills and get
            hired as a software engineer. Eventually, someone told me to make
            FreeMind public and to charge a high monthly subscription. I then
            decided to make FreeMind Recovery 100% free for all users. In the
            future I may begin to charge a small subscription fee of 4.99, but I
            still refuse to charge anything more than $10 a month. When I was at
            my lowest in financial ruins, I could not afford a $100 DPDR course,
            a $300 anxiety course, and a $250 OCD course. I would feel hopeless
            looking at those prices on the internet, and to this day, it still
            bothers me. I am making FreeMind accessible to everyone. Here at
            FreeMind, we believe everyone deserves to have access to treatment,
            regardless of financial limitations.{" "}
