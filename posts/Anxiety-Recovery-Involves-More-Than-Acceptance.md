You probably hear it constantly: "Accept the anxiety, and you will recover." The issue here is that this statement fails to address one critical factor: nervous system and mental health recovery. Although acceptance is important in recovery, it isn't the one and only cure-it-all solution for anxiety.

### Physical, Emotional, and Mental Well-Being

One aspect many people overlook in anxiety recovery is their physical, mental, and emotional well-being. We often discard this aspect, thinking acceptance is the only cure for anxiety. If that's true, then consider who will recover first in this example.

John suffers from severe anxiety, but he makes sure to take care of himself. John ensures he gets a minimum of seven hours of sleep a day. He maintains an adequate amount of exercise, eats a healthy diet, keeps up with his meditation and relaxation techniques, and minimizes stress and worry as much as possible. Once John feels too stressed, he steps back and manages his stress to ensure it doesn't get out of hand. He rearranges his schedule when necessary, and keeps up with his acceptance techniques.

On the other hand, Michael keeps up with his acceptance techniques but continues to lead a poor lifestyle. Michael works 70 hours a week, gets 4-6 hours of sleep per day on average, eats unhealthily, and lives in a very stressful environment. He constantly worries about bills, work, and school, and continues to live a fast-paced lifestyle.

Now answer this: which person do you expect will recover more quickly or achieve a lasting recovery? Michael might not only fail to recover, but he may also worsen his situation and make his anxiety even more debilitating. Anxiety involves more than just acceptance. It requires a combination of nervous system recovery, patience, and eliminating or managing anxious behaviors.

### A Dysregulated Nervous System

Due to constant chronic stress, anxious behaviors, and leading an overall poor lifestyle, a person's nervous system can become dysregulated. Once your nervous system becomes dysregulated and is filled with stress hormones, it can make recovery 1000 times harder. That is why accepting anxiety isn't a cure-it-all solution. You need to live a healthy lifestyle to ensure your nervous system gets the proper recovery.

### Anxiety Recovery Is Different For Everyone

Anxiety recovery is different for all individuals. Maybe you currently don't work and live with your parents. You don't have kids and only deal with school work and doing mundane tasks around the house. Due to your current situation, you don't really have to deal with stress management as much. You can focus on keeping up with acceptance, relaxation, and panic attack/anxiety elimination techniques. You ensure that when stressful situations occur, you don't overreact and eliminate anxious behaviors.

On the contrary, perhaps you grapple with a considerable amount of chronic stress. You live with a large family and are responsible for four children. You work a stressful job that typically demands 40-50 hours of your time each week. Furthermore, you might also operate a side business, which continues to worsten your stress and amplify your anxious behaviors. In such a situation, recovery from anxiety becomes more difficult. You need to utilize stress management techniques and focus on eliminating anxious behaviors more than you would if you led a calm lifestyle. On top of stress management, you need to ensure you keep up with acceptance, relaxation, and panic attack/anxiety elimination techniques.

Some of us indeed have a more challenging time, while others may find it easier to recover from anxiety. This isn't only due to our different environments and nervous systems but also because we experience varying levels of anxiety, ranging from mild to severe.
