Anxiety is notorious for causing sleep disturbances and causing irregularities in one's sleep. When someone has dealt with anxiety for years, they are most likely dealing with a dysregulated nervous system (Nervous system dysregulation). Nervous system dysregulation causes a state of imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. That is when the body becomes stuck in a "fight or flight" mode, and the fight or flight mode causes several symptoms, including insomnia and other sleep-related issues. I dealt with pretty severe insomnia during my anxiety recovery journey.

### Understanding the Connection

The relationship between anxiety and insomnia is complex yet understandable. Anxiety induces a state of heightened awareness and physiological arousal, making it difficult for the mind and body to relax enough to fall asleep or stay asleep. This can lead to a vicious cycle where the dread of not getting enough sleep further worsens anxiety, making insomnia even worse.

When I dealt with bad insomnia, one mistake I made was trying to fix my sleeping schedule, when the real issue was the underlying anxiety and stress. I was targeting the symptoms rather than the underlying issues and root cause of the problems. During high periods of stress and anxiety, I struggled to get more than 2-3 hours of sleep a day. Insomnia and restlessness are all symptoms of anxiety and a dysregulated nervous system. We have to tackle the core problem, which is first eliminating anxiety and then letting your nervous system recover.

Once you tackle anxiety and your nervous system has enough time to recover, almost all symptoms you are dealing with will begin to subside. Below are practical tips for you to overcome insomnia. Remember, the root cause is anxiety, stress, and a dysregulated nervous system, but these tips could still significantly help you manage and possibly beat insomnia. The tips below have helped me beat insomnia for over two years.

### Practical Tips for Managing Insomnia Cause by Anxiety

1. **Establish a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:** Create a series of relaxing activities before bed, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing meditation. This can signal to your body that it’s time to wind down and go to sleep.

2. **Limit Screen Time:** The blue light emitted by screens can interfere with your ability to fall asleep. Try to avoid electronic devices at least an hour before bed.

3. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Practice mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation, it can help calm the mind and prepare your body for sleep. Example: Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Tense and then slowly relax each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head.

4. **Exercise Regularly:** Engaging in regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and deepen your sleep. However, try not to exercise too close to bedtime as it can energize you.

5. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:** Both substances can significantly impact your sleep quality. Limit intake, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime.

6. **Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment:** Ensure your bedroom promotes a good sleep environment – think cool, quiet, and comfortable. Investing in a good quality mattress and pillows can also make a significant difference.

7. **Stick to a Schedule:** Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. A consistent sleep schedule helps regulate your body’s internal clock.

8. **Try Sleep Teas:** Drinking a warm cup of herbal tea or sleep tea before bed can help you wind down and get a good night's rest.

9. **Listening to Relaxing Sounds:** Listening to ASMR, nature sounds, or other relaxing sounds could help you fall asleep through the night. To this day, I listen to nature sounds to fall asleep since it helps me get a good night's rest every night.
