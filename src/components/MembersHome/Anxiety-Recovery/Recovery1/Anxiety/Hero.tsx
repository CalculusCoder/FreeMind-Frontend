          Eliminate Anxiety
        </header>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Eliminating anxiety is very similar to the eliminating panic attacks
          approach. When eliminating anxiety, we still use the R.A.R.L.M method,
          but we make some slight adjustments to them. Some content may be
          repetitive, but please read through it. As mentioned previously, there
          are hundreds of different variations of the method I am about to show
          you. All of them generally accomplish the same thing. I would list
          them for members, but I want to avoid dealing with copyright issues.
          The main thing I can say is that the pioneer of anxiety disorder
          recovery is Dr. Claire Weekes, she created the original method, and
          from there, many people have made their own variations. So, let&apos;s
          get started.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">
          Mild, Moderate, High, Severe
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          This method is perfect for any anxiety level. It does not matter if
          you have very low anxiety or even more severe episodes of anxiety. For
          panic attacks, please check out the panic attack section. Also, note
          that high-intense anxiety episodes are different than panic attacks.
          High-intense anxiety episodes are short-lived, they may feel like a
          panic attack, but you would be able to tell the difference if you have
          had both.
        </p>

          R.A.R.L.M
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          To contain anxiety, use the R.A.R.L.M. method. Note that this is a
          long-term recovery strategy. Over time, you will notice that you will
          have fewer anxiety episodes and with less intensity. The good thing
          about using the R.A.R.L.M. method with anxiety is that anxiety happens
          way more often than panic attacks. Using the R.A.R.L.M. with anxiety
          gives you the ability to practice the techniques you will learn more
          often. It can prepare you for any future random panic attacks or, even
          better, prevent you from ever getting to that point! If you have
          anxiety but no panic attacks, consider yourself blessed. We will
          ensure you put an end to your anxiety before it can lead to high
          levels of anxiety disorder.

        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">R: RECOGNIZE</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Step one, RECOGNIZE. You must recognize what is happening in your
          body. You may be plagued with a million thoughts and feel like
          escaping a situation or running away. It is essential to recognize if
          you are having anxiety, a panic attack, or just bad intrusive
          thoughts. Recognizing this will help you understand what to prepare
          for. Maybe you also get a million intrusive thoughts at the moment:
          what if I die right here? What if I go crazy? What if I lose my
          career? What if I faint? These are all part of the stress response. In
          the next section, we will discuss how to eliminate negative intrusive
          thoughts. This is an approach many people with OCD take and works
          amazing for people with anxiety as well. Remember, your nervous system
          is firing these sensations and symptoms to try to protect you.
          Recognize that you are having an anxiety episode or just a false fire
          alarm. There is 0 harm coming your way, the thief and bear do not
          exist, and your stress response is activating even though you are
          safe!
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          When RECOGNIZING, it may be helpful to make an analogy. You can tell
          yourself things like there is no bear, no thief, this is just a false
          fire alarm, and there is no fire. You can also imagine your panic
          attacks and anxiety as a small harmless germ that is throwing a temper
          tantrum. This can help with recognizing and slightly eliminating the
          fear of a panic attack.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">
          A: ACCEPT AND ALLOW
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          This is the heart of anxiety and panic attack recovery. Once you
          RECOGNIZE what is going on, you then ACCEPT AND ALLOW the panic
          attack. This is a scientifically backed approach (A.C.T.). Whatever
          you resist comes back with full force. DO NOT RESIST; this will make
          your situation worst. Not only are there studies to scientifically
          prove this, but I am also talking out of experience. Acceptance is the
          way you respond to anxiety and panic attacks. You either respond with
          acceptance or with resistance. Respond with acceptance. So what does
          it mean then to accept and allow? This means not running away from
          your situation, allow the discomfort, the symptoms, the feelings, and
          the fear to float with you. You may be at a huge mall and feel
          completely overwhelmed and stimulated. You begin to experience a lot
          of anxiety and other symptoms: shortness of breath, trembling arms and
          legs, and sweating. What do you do? You do NOT escape; you accept all
          the anxiety and move aside if you need to, but you don&apos;t escape.
          Stand with the anxiety; allow the discomfort, symptoms, and thoughts
          to stand with you. Show anxiety that you are not afraid of it and
          accept and allow it(remember this takes time to implement correctly).
          You will not die, you will not faint, you will not choke. Let the
          anxiety float and stand with you at the mall. Imagine anxiety to be a
          funny germ-looking cartoon throwing a temper tantrum. Tell it that you
          will allow everything it throws at you. You can also imagine a fire
          alarm; if you let the fire alarm continue to sound, nothing will
          happen. Yes, the fire alarm is loud and annoying, but just sit and
          allow the symptoms, feelings, discomfort, and fears the fire alarm
          throws at you. It will eventually turn off if you accept these
          feelings. When accepting, you must get ready to get comfortable with
          being uncomfortable. Acceptance is one of the most challenging things
          to master in the R.A.R.L.M. method.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Acceptance is one of the most difficult things to master in the
          R.A.R.L.M method. The reason is that you have to face your fears deep
          down inside and meet face-to-face with something you feel to be a huge
          threat to you. You have to invite it to stay with you and allow it to
          throw whatever symptoms and sensations at you. Another reason why
          accepting and allowing is hard to master is that many people accept in
          their minds but do not truly accept within. That is okay; I was the
          same way at the beginning. Initially, when I used to have bad anxiety,
          I would tell myself, I accept and allow you, in my head repeatedly.
          The funny thing is that I would still run away from the situation and
          keep resisting. You may make the same mistakes as me, but over time
          you will begin to see the true meaning of accepting and allowing.
          Remember, accept, and allow all the feelings, panic, dissociation,
          fears, intrusive thoughts, and shortness of breath. Let your body
          throw its temper tantrum and observe it, it will pass, and you will be
          okay every SINGLE TIME!
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-purple-500 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          DO NOT ESCAPE. It may seem impossible, but you need to conquer these
          fears. You need to rewire your brain and nervous system to get
          comfortable in these situations. If you keep escaping, panic attacks
          and anxiety will rule your life.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Tell your brain and nervous system that the place you are in is not a
          threat, and the anxiety will soon subside! We will discuss exposing
          yourself to your fears in the eliminating fears sections.

        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">
          R: RELAX (OPTIONAL)
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          This step is optional for eliminating general anxiety. It is
          recommended for panic attacks, since panic attacks are of higher
          intensity. But for general anxiety that is MILD to MODERATE, you can
          skip this step and move to the MOVE ON section! If you believe that
          this step works for your anxiety, you can always still integrate it to
          your routine!
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Take a step back and RELAX. For the RELAX phase, you should start
          doing deep breathing exercises and breathing techniques. There are
          several different ones on the internet, but we will also show you some
          in later sections. We recommend looking up different techniques to see
          which one is best for you. On top of breathing exercises, you should
          find anything you believe will help you calm down. One of the best
          things that helped me was putting headphones on and listening to
          relaxation audio. Here at FreeMind, we have several different
          relaxation audios that can be used for panic and anxiety. Meditation
          is also a technique that can be used in the RELAX phase that can help
          someone calm down. Remember, different things work for different
          people. You need to find what works best for you. Audios may work
          great for me but may not work for some members. For the RELAX phase,
          here at FreeMind, we recommend a combination of breathing exercises
          and relaxation audio. Generally speaking, the RELAX phase is easier to
          implement for anxiety than for panic attacks. Usually, a good
          combination of breathing exercises and visualization was enough for
          me. For visualization, I disconnected my mind mentally from my
          surroundings and visualized being on a beach or calm mountain. For
          panic attacks, I would take it a step further and use relaxation
          audio. The goal is to find a good combination that works for you and
          stick with it!
        </p>

          RELAX. Find a great combination of relaxation techniques that work
          great for you! Deep breathing exercises, relaxation audios, or

          LET TIME PASS (OPTIONAL)
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          This step ties in with the RELAX phase. It is optional for eliminating
          general anxiety. It is recommended for panic attacks, since panic
          attacks are of higher intensity. But for general anxiety that is MILD
          to MODERATE, you can skip this step and move to the MOVE ON section!
          If you believe that this step works for your anxiety, you can always
          still integrate it to your routine!
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          In the LET TIME PASS phase, you need to do exactly what the name
          implements, let time pass! Thankfully for anxiety, the let time pass
          phase is shorter than that in panic attacks. Anxiety is usually
          short-lived, so you won&apos;t have to wait long until the symptoms
          and sensations disappear. Remember, you must be comfortable with being
          uncomfortable. Keep implementing the acceptance and relaxation
          techniques until the anxiety completely passes. Also, it&apos;s easier
          to recover from an anxiety episode than a panic attack episode. Try
          not to spend too much time in this stage if you have an anxiety
          episode(unless you need to); once you are ready to move on, MOVE ON!
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-blue-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Your health comes first. Make sure to talk to any bosses, coworkers,
          or friends that need to understand your situation. Tell them you need
          a moment to let time pass to allow your body to return to homeostasis.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">M: MOVE ON</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          This step is especially important for mild to moderate anxiety, since
          mild to moderate anxiety does not stick around for long. In this
          phase, you need to MOVE ON. MOVE ON and ENGAGE in whichever activity
          you did before the anxiety episode. The move-on phase is essential
          because you make sure you pay no attention to your racing mind. Your
          brain is probably throwing 1000 different questions, and you probably
          have 1000 questions, but you need to move on as if nothing just
          happened. This will rewire your brain to focus on what&apos;s
          important. If you are at work, engage thoroughly in your work. If you
          are at the movie theater, engage thoroughly in the movie. It does not
          matter what you are doing; engage in anything you can find. Moving on
          is important because it is part of the acceptance process. If you move
          on as if nothing happened, your brain and nervous system will begin to
          understand that there is no threat. But, if you focus on it and glue
          your mind to it, your brain will still believe this is a threat and
          continue throwing fears and anxiety at you.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Remember the analogy of the little germ throwing a temper tantrum?
          That little germ may get furious that you are paying it no attention
          and accepting it for what it is. It may continue throwing tantrums
          (anxiety), but that is okay. Continue with the R.A.R.L.M method, and
          over time that germ will get tired and notice that those
          tantrums/anxiety are not causing you any harm. Eventually, it will
          leave you alone, and the anxiety will subside.
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-blue-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          The R.A.R.L.M method is a long-term strategy. It is not intended to
          get rid of anxiety and panic attacks in 1 day. With the R.A.R.L.M
          method, you rewire your brain and nervous system to act normally. You
          are teaching them that there is no threat; the bear and thief do not
          exist!
