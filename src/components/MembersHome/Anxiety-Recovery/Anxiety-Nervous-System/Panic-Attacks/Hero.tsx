          Panic Attacks
        </header>
        <p className="text-lg">
          A panic attack can be one of the scariest things to deal with in
          anxiety disorder recovery. But what even is a panic attack? Panic
          attacks are episodes of intense fear or discomfort that usually occur
          unexpectedly. When you have a panic attack, you will be overcome with
          a huge episode of dread, fear, feeling of going crazy, dissociation,
          DPDR, intrusive thoughts, shortness of breath, increased heart rate,
          and more. It is one of the scariest things a person can experience. At
          times it may feel like you might die. Many people mistake panic
          attacks for heart attacks at times. Panic attacks can range from mild
          to severe.

          Throughout my life, I never noticed that I dealt with occasional mild
          panic attacks. They became way more frequent when I began experiencing
          severe trauma and stress. Their intensity also increased. Sometimes
          you may feel them coming, and other times they will punch you in the
          gut out of nowhere. The fact that they occur unexpectedly is also why
          they are frightening. People with panic disorder or panic attacks are
          afraid of having another episode. They avoid places where they have
          panic attacks and memories of it; this creates more fear and feeds
          into a negative anxiety loop.

            A person that has a panic attack while driving will avoid driving
            again. These new fears will restrict them from driving. A person
            that has a panic attack in an elevator will avoid ever getting on an
            elevator again.

          Unfortunately, with panic attacks, this is destined to happen. They
          are so frightening and severe that people can only avoid situations
          thinking it will help. The truth is that panic attacks do not care
          where or who you are with; they will strike anywhere at any time. When
          I had my severe panic attack that night, I gained a million new fears
          overnight. I was scared to go to my apartment and room. I was
          traumatized by my own apartment. I was afraid to get on elevators and
          even go outside at one point.

          Panic Attacks: A Huge Problem
        </header>
        <p className="text-lg mt-8">
          Panic attacks are one of the biggest problems in anxiety recovery and
          nervous system dysregulation recovery. The problem with panic attacks
          is that they are high-intensity episodes of fear accompanied by
          HIGH-INTENSITY stress responses. With each panic attack, your nervous
          system becomes extremely dysregulated. Imagine stress as small little
          fireballs. The more small fireball damage you take, the more your
          nervous system becomes dysregulated. A panic attack is like a
          meteorite! It comes with a high-intensity stress response that will
          damage your nervous system pretty badly.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mt-8">
          That is why many people say their anxiety issues began with a panic
          attack. Overnight, all my anxiety issues, OCD, and DPDR began with one
          huge panic attack. Whenever I felt like I was recovering, I would get
          hit with another severe panic attack and feel as if I returned back to
          square one. We need to eliminate panic attacks in order to give our
          bodies time to recover. Remember, panic attacks are of high intensity;
          it is like they are causing 100 days of damage in one episode.

          How does panic attack recovery look like?
        </header>
        <p className="text-lg mt-8">
          You will not get rid of panic attacks overnight. It is a process. You
          know you are recovering when your panic attacks become less frequent,
          less intense, and last less time. My first big panic attack lasted
          over 4 hours and was extremely intense. I would have panic attacks
          every week, and it felt like it would set me back years. It made my
          DPDR and OCD 1000 times worst. The moral of the story is this, panic
          attacks are horrible and are the first thing we will tackle in anxiety
          recovery. Please be patient with panic attack recovery since it is one
          of the hardest things to overcome. Be gentle with yourself and your
          body.
