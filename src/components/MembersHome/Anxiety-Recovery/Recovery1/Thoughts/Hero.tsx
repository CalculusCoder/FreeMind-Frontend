          Eliminate Intrusive Thoughts (Great for OCD)
        </header>
        <p className="text-lg">
          We have not had the chance to talk about intrusive thoughts that much.
          Let us give it a quick definition. An intrusive thought refers to an
          unwelcome or involuntary thought, image, or idea that repeatedly
          enters a person&apos;s mind. These thoughts often come spontaneously
          and can be disturbing, distressing, or contrary to a person&apos;s
          values or beliefs. Intrusive thoughts are typically repetitive,
          invasive, and difficult to control or dismiss. These thoughts can be
          thoughts, ideas, or vivid images that are extremely disturbing to us.
          Some examples of intrusive thoughts can be constant thoughts of
          getting cancer, thoughts of developing schizophrenia (Schiz O.C.D.),
          thoughts of losing control, vivid images of suicide, thoughts of
          hurting a loved one, and many other crazy thoughts/images. Remember,
          thoughts are INVOLUNTARY; you cannot control them. They come randomly
          at you due to your brain and nervous system. Intrusive thoughts are
          inevitable in anxiety and O.C.D. The problem with intrusive thoughts
          is that they FEEL SO REAL. Because they feel so real, we respond with
          fear, making our thoughts stickier in our brains. With this
          resistance, the thoughts will never dissipate from our brains. We give
          them the fear it wants; it is powered by fear and continues to grow
          because of it. An unwanted intrusive thought caused my big panic
          attack. I had no idea how to respond to it, so I responded with fear,
          which led to panic attacks and anxiety. In this section, we will go
          over the R.A.R.M. method to overcome unwanted and intrusive thoughts
          forever!

          R.A.R.M
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          We will use the R.A.R.M. method to overcome unwanted and intrusive
          thoughts. This method is a long-term recovery strategy; the more you
          practice it, the better you will overcome the thoughts. Once your
          brain realizes that the thoughts it sends you are not bothering you,
          it will stop. Remember, if you fear something, your brain will send
          these thoughts to you immediately. We need to rewire our brains so it
          can understand that there is no threat and no need for these thoughts!
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">R: RECOGNIZE</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          RECOGNIZE the thought. Recognize that it is just a thought, nothing
          else. It feels so real, but that is all it is. A thought that feels
          very real. You will NOT act on that thought. If you need to say this
          in your head or aloud, do it. - &quot;This is an intrusive thought; my
          brain randomly sent me this. I might feel scared because it feels
          real, but it is just a thought.&quot;
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Imagine your thoughts like clouds. They are in your head, floating
          around; some are dark, and some are light. If you give the dark ones a
          reaction, they will start throwing rain on you. Recognize the thought,
          and watch it float in your head.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">
          A: ACCEPT AND ALLOW
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Once you observe the &quot;cloud&quot;(thought) float in your head,
          ACCEPT AND ALLOW it. DO NOT RESIST IT; whatever you resist will come
          back stronger. It is okay to feel scared at times, but it is vital
          that you do NOT resist but instead accept. Let it stay in your head;
          let it float around for some time. It CAN&apos;T cause you any harm,
          it wants to make you fearful, but that is all it can do. Not only
          should you accept the negative thought, but you should also accept the
          feelings they bring. They may bring anxiety or fear; accept that too.
          Tell the thought you have no problem with it being there; it is a
          harmless thought trying to be a big bully. These negative thoughts
          want to get a reaction from you; make sure you don&apos;t give the
          thoughts the reaction they want. Show them you genuinely don&apos;t
          care about them and will accept them.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Acceptance is one of the most challenging things to master in the
          R.A.R.M method. The reason is that you have to, deep down inside, face
          your fears and come face to face with something you feel to be a huge
          threat to you. You must invite it to stay with you and allow it to
          throw fears and sensations at you. Another reason why accepting and
          allowing is hard to master is because many people accept in their
          minds but do not truly accept within. That is okay; I was the same way
          at the beginning. But that is what practice is for; immediately
          implement the R.A.R.M method whenever you get a negative thought.
        </p>

          Intrusive thoughts are like clouds. Some of them are light some of
          them are dark. Give the dark clouds a reaction, and they will begin
          raining down on you. Show the thought that you genuinely do not care
          about it.

        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">
          R: RELAX (OPTIONAL)
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          This step is optional for eliminating intrusive thoughts, it all
          depends on the level of anxiety you have when you get these intrusive
          thoughts. If you encounter high to very high anxiety or a panic attack
          with your intrusive thoughts, this step is 100% recommended since it
          helps desensitize your nervous system. But if you encounter mild to
          moderate anxiety with your intrusive thoughts, you can skip this step
          and move to the MOVE ON section! If you believe that this step works
          for your anxiety, you can always still integrate it to your routine!
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          If these thoughts were accompanied by an intense negative feeling of
          doom, fear, or anxiety, give yourself time to RELAX. Remember to use
          the R.A.R.L.M. for any instances of anxiety or panic attacks. For the
          RELAX phase, you should start to do deep breathing exercises,
          breathing techniques, and visualization. There are several different
          breathing exercises on the internet, but we will also show you some in
          later sections. We recommend looking up different techniques to see
          which one is best for you. On top of breathing exercises and
          visualization, you should find anything that will help you calm down.
          Once you are done with the relax phase, MOVE ON as soon as possible to
          the MOVE ON phase. It is a crucial part of getting rid of intrusive
          thoughts.
        </p>
        <header className="text-center text-3xl mt-16">M: MOVE ON</header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          I cannot stress this enough, the MOVE ON phase is crucial to
          eliminating intrusive thoughts. With the move-on phase, you tell your
          brain that you do NOT fear these thoughts. By moving on, you take away
          all significance from the negative intrusive thoughts. I have
          eliminated over 70% of negative thoughts with the R.A.R.M method,
          especially by implementing the last phase. Here&apos;s the thing, you
          may kill off the thought temporarily, but as soon as it strikes back
          again, keep using the R.A.R.M method. You will get great practice at
          accepting, allowing, and moving on.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          MOVE ON and ENGAGE in an activity you were doing. By engaging in an
          activity, you are rewiring your brain to recognize that thoughts are
          harmless. You are removing all significance from the thoughts. If you
          get intrusive thoughts while on the computer, continue engaging
          heavily in the computer. If you are driving and get bad intrusive
          thoughts, focus your attention heavily on driving or on the road. Try
          to shift your 100% attention and thoughts to the activity you were
          doing. This will become easier over time with good practice.
