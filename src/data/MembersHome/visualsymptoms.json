    "title": "Eye Floaters / Increase In Eye Floaters",
    "description": "Eye floaters are small specks or cobweb-like shapes that appear in your vision. They can look like small black dots, lines, webs, or a clump of cells. Floaters can also be transparent and vary in size, shape, and opacity. Floaters are most noticeable in bright environments. Heightened anxiety or stress can increase your awareness of floaters and make them more noticeable. ",
    "cause": "The cause for this symptom is because of the stress response or nervous system dysregulation. Your nervous system begins to throw all types of crazy symptoms at you. Nervous system dysregulation can bring on a plethora of visual symptoms like floaters, visual snow, and tunnel vision. As mentioned earlier, heightened anxiety or stress can increase your awareness of floaters and make them more noticeable. ",
    "treatment": "The R.A.R.L.M method can be used to tackle this symptom at the moment. Long-term acceptance is also an excellent strategy for this symptom. Remember that the R.A.R.L.M method is a long-term strategy, especially if you suffer from nervous system dysregulation. If this symptom causes anxiety, practice the deep relaxation techniques you have learned and listen to FreeMind relaxation audio if necessary. Practice FreeMind stress reduction techniques, self-care, and patience for this symptom. Try to treat eye floaters like intrusive thoughts; they are harmless but annoying/disturbing. ",
    "myexperience": "I experienced eye floaters and an increase in eye floaters due to anxiety. When I would have high anxiety episodes or panic attacks, I would notice way more floaters in my vision. It was hard to tell if it was because I was hyperaware of them or because they increased in number. I had a mix of floaters: clumps of transparent cells, black lines, and black cobwebs. When I would be extremely anxious or stressed, I would notice them more. "
