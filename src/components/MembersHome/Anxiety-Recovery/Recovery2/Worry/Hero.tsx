          Worry: Putting an end to Anxious Behavior
        </header>
        <p className="text-lg">
          In order for us to let your nervous system make a recovery, we need to
          put an end to worry. There are two types of worries, rational and
          irrational. Examples of irrational worries are worries about getting
          cancer, worries about death, or worries about harm. Examples of
          rational worries are: Worries about paying the bills. Worries about
          getting work done on time. Worries about succeeding. We need to put an
          end to all worries if possible. In previous sections, we have already
          covered how to get rid of irrational worries, anxiety, and intrusive
          thoughts. In this section, we will talk about ending rational worries.

          Worry Leads to Stress
        </header>
        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          Worrying involves repetitive and negative thinking about potential
          problems or future uncertainties. When a person excessively engages in
          worry, it can trigger a stress response in the body. This stress
          response releases hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Persistent
          worry can lead to chronic stress or nervous system dysregulation.
          Constant worries about the future, finances, and work led me to have
          chronic stress. Throughout my first years in college, I did not deal
          with worry and chronic stress. I had a balance in my life: a good
          sleeping schedule, a good routine, and a good work/school life
          balance. I made sure not to stress too much over school or work.
          Eventually, I dropped out of school and took a full-time position at
          the family business. I immediately regretted it, but I decided to give
          it a chance for 1-2 years to see how it would play out. When I took on
          that full-time position, I became a chronic worrier. I worried about
          everything at work, home, and life. I kept stressing and worrying
          about my future and the security behind my future. This happened every
          day for two years until, eventually, my body developed chronic
          stress/nervous system dysregulation. I noticed that I began to
          struggle to fall asleep, I was always grumpy and irritable, and my
          stress response was easily more activated. If there was traffic, I
          started having anxiety, shortness of breath, sweating, and trembling.
          Normal situations were not so normal for me, my nervous system was
          damaged, and I needed rest. Unfortunately, I did not listen to my body
          and continued to live a fast-paced life and worry daily.

          Put and end to worry

        <p className="mt-8 text-lg">
          You need to put an end to all worries. Worries do not end; they
          continue to plague you forever. The only way they end is if YOU put an
          end to it. In life, there is always something to worry about! Worrying
          is a way of coping with your rational fears. The thing is that
          worrying does not make your future more secure or does not guarantee
          you will get your work done on time. It just damages your nervous
          system even more. Here is one of the best quotes I have heard about
          worrying: Do not worry about tomorrow because tomorrow will worry
          about itself. Whenever you get a rational worry: &quot;I do not have
          enough to pay the bills,&quot; &quot;I do not have anything to wear
          tomorrow,&quot; &quot;I do not have a car to get to work
          tomorrow,&quot; or &quot;How will I fix my car,&quot; tell yourself
          this. &quot;Worry will NOT fix my situation. Worry has no say in if I
          resolve or don&apos;t resolve my problem. I can resolve this issue by
          worrying chronically or by being relaxed; I need to decide.&quot;

          Tips to end worry

          EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAS A SOLUTION. I can say this from experience, from
          losing everything in my life to finally recovering and gaining
          everything back. Worrying did not prevent my situation; it made it
          worst. When worry strikes, here are some things you can tell yourself.

          What is the worst that can happen? &quot;I still have a car, my
          family, my health, my house, and I have people who love me.&quot;
          &quot;What if I am late to the event?&quot; So what, what&apos;s the
          worst that can happen? Nothing. &quot;What if I turn in the work
          assignment late? So what? I either do or don&apos;t. I will not lose
          my job.&quot; &quot;What if I lose my job? So what if I do? I will
          find another one fast and one that pays even more.&quot; &quot;What if
          I don&apos;t pay the bills on time?&quot; So what? EVERYTHING HAS A
          SOLUTION. Worrying will deteriorate your health and not help your
          situation. Worry is not helping you pay the bills or find you a new
          job; it is just damaging your nervous system.

          Focus on the present and be grateful. Focusing on the present
          ultimately ended my chronic worry over success or finding a job. I
          lost everything to my name due to anxiety, leaving me thousands in
          debt. After eight months of being unable to function, I got a
          low-paying job at a supermarket. I was grateful! I was grateful to be
          able to work even if I was not making ends meet. I told myself
          tomorrow would worry about itself. Focus on today because tomorrow is
          not promised. When the bill comes in the mail, tell yourself, &quot;I
          will handle it then, but for now, I will live my life.&quot;
        </p>
        <p className="border-2 border-cyan-300 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mt-8 text-lg">
          Accept uncertainty. You cannot control everything; it is time to
          practice letting go. Accept that there will be uncertainties in your
          life. A new bill might come up; your car might break down; you might
          lose your job. Accept it, and recognize that you will take care of
          that situation the day it happens(although very unlikely).

          &quot;I will worry about you in 2 hours.&quot; Whenever you get a
          random worry, tell yourself, &quot;I will worry about you in 2
          hours.&quot; Then in 2 hours, if the worry comes up, tell yourself you
          will worry about that in 2 hours. Keep repeating this, and you will
          see that you did not worry at all by the end of the day. The situation
          might still be present, but your mental health is in good shape now.
          Remember this; worry does not make the bills disappear or fix your
          problem; it just deteriorates your mental health.
